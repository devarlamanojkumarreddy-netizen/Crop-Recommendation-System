# Crop-Recommendation-System
Built an ML-based system to suggest suitable crops using soil and climate data. Achieved up to 98.7% accuracy with LightGBM and deployed a real-time Streamlit app. Used PyTorch for neural networks and applied LIME and feature analysis for model interpretability.



### Duration
**From:** February 2025â€ƒâ€ƒ**To:** March 2025  
**Team Size:** 1
**Mentor:** Prof. SUBHASHINI R


### Project Overview
